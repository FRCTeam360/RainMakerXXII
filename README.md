ðŸŸ§Team 360 - The Revolution's 2022 Robot CodeðŸŸ¦

This is Team 360's entire code used for the 2022 Rapid React FRC season. We won our Auburn District Event and won the Industrial Design Award at Clackamas but unfortunately did not make it to World's ðŸ˜¢. 
It's really messy, but we're going to fix that so look out for a new repo with better code.

Our major innovation this year was Field Oriented Drive for our West Coast drivetrain along with our homemade turret code.

AdiÃ³s! Bye y'all!! See ya later!!! ðŸ‘‹!!!!
